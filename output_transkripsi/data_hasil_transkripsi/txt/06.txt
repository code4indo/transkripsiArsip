SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT SUKARNO
AT THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE TJIKOTOK GOLDMINE
ON JULY 12, 1958.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Today I have the honour to perform two tasks; firstly, the
official opening of the Tjikotok Goldmine, and secondly, together with
Sultan Hamengku Buwono — who is now here among the audience — I shall
inspect tourist objects near Pelabuhan Ratu.

I would like, first of all, to say a few words about tourism.

"tourism". Earlier I said that compulsory excursions by schoolchildren
are called "darmawisata" in Indonesia, "Darma" means "duty", "wisata"
stands for "excursions". But for "tourism" which is not done by school
children and which is not compulsory, the word "darmawisata" is not
quite
