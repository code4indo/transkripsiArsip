of a strong country. Indeed, we have to be especially vigilant
lately, because there have been clear indications of activities from
within as well as outside the country to undermine and to divide, even
to destroy our Republic. That is why the whole Indonesian nation must
be alert and prepared for eventualities.

It is with feelings of joy and gratification that I open the
Tjikotok goldmine today, because it constitutes a step in the right
direction towards economic defensibleness; indirectly it also brings
us closer to military as well as political defensibleness.

If the Indonesian people remain united spiritually and also
remain united in their endeavours, determination and their prayers, the
Indonesian nation inevitably will become a strong nation. The Republic
of Indonesia will become a strong Republic. There is no doubt about
it, because I firmly believe that God will crown our efforts with
success and will grant us whatever we request or pray for.

I declare the Tjikotok goldmine open. Thank you.
