Military defensibleness should not be neglected either, and
it is wellknown to all of you that we are now increasing our military
defensibleness. Our Navy, Army as well as our Airforce are
getting stronger every day. However, we should not only strengthen
our armed forces, but the whole Indonesian nation should be made
fully aware of this military defensibleness.

From what I have said just now it is clear that "unity and
vigilance" are but part of the general effort in order to strengthen
and to safeguard our country.

It is indeed true that unity is a very important factor,
especially in our endeavours towards the achievement of political, military
as well as economic defensibleness. I have repeated again and again
that in order to build up a strong economy, Indonesia should base it
on unity.

When I opened the Ratatex textile factory in Balongbendo some
time ago, I stated clearly that none of the islands of Indonesia can
stand alone economically, whether Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi,
Bali, Lombok, Flores, Sumba or Timor. We are one nation whose economy
should also be united. Therefore, we should not consider the Tjikotok
goldmine as a property of Tjikotok only, neither is it owned by West
Java alone, but the Tjikotok goldmine is for the benefit of the whole
of Indonesia. The same applies to the Ratatex factory which is a
private enterprise for the benefit of the whole of Indonesia. The
Gresik cement factory is another example which is catering to the
needs of the whole Indonesian nation. The same goes for the Indarung
cement factory and the Madukismo sugar factory under the direction
of Sultan Hamengku Buwono. A sense of unity must be strongly imprinted
in our minds, not only in the military field, but also in the political
as well as the economic field.

Vigilance as mentioned in the slogan on the wall here behind
me is, as I said before, but one of the pre-requisites for the building
of

ARSIP NASIONAL REPUBLIK INDONESIA
