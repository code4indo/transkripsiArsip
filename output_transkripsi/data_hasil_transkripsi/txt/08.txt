Republic asembodied in the Proclamation of the 17th. of August 1945.
Those adventurers have attempted to destroy the unity which we built
up and cultivated for scores of years before the 17th of August 1945
by launching the socalled PRRI and the Permesta rebellions and by
propagating ideas of afederal structure of the Republic among certain
groups. These efforts have failed completely, both in the PRRI as well
as in the Permesta regions. The people completely refuse to listen to
the rebels' enticement and have demonstrated conclusively that poli-
tical defensibleness as the first requisite for a strong nation is
fully understood and firmly embedded in their hearts. We may thank
God for this.
With regard to the second requirement: economic defensibleness,
the opening of the Tjikutok goldmine which we are witnessing today is
one effort in that direction. I therefore perform this task with
great pleasure and I call upon all the staff and the workers of the
Tjikutok goldmine to give their best efforts in order to restore pre-
war production in the shortest possible time and afterwards even to
exceed that production.
