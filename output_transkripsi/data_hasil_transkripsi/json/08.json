These efforts have failed completely, both in the PRRI as well\nas in the Permesta regions. The people completely refuse to listen to\nthe rebels' enticement and have demonstrated conclusively that poli-\ntical defensibleness as the first requisite for a strong nation is\nfully understood and firmly embedded in their hearts. We may thank\nGod for this.\nWith regard to the second requirement: economic defensibleness,\nthe opening of the Tjikutok goldmine which we are witnessing today is\none effort in that direction. I therefore perform this task with\ngreat pleasure and I call upon all the staff and the workers of the\nTjikutok goldmine to give their best efforts in order to restore pre-\nwar production in the shortest possible time and afterwards even to\nexceed that production.\n\nMilitary"
