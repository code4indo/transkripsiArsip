Our Navy, Army as well as our Airforce are\ngetting stronger every day. However, we should not only strengthen\nour armed forces, but the whole Indonesian nation should be made\nfully aware of this military defensibleness.\n\nFrom what I have said just now it is clear that \"unity and\nvigilance\" are but part of the general effort in order to strengthen\nand to safeguard our country.\n\nIt is indeed true that unity is a very important factor,\nespecially in our endeavours towards the achievement of political, military\nas well as economic defensibleness. I have repeated again and again\nthat in order to build up a strong economy, Indonesia should base it\non unity.\n\nWhen I opened the Ratatex textile factory in Balongbendo some\ntime ago, I stated clearly that none of the islands of Indonesia can\nstand alone economically, whether Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi,\nBali, Lombok, Flores, Sumba or Timor. We are one nation whose economy\nshould also be united. Therefore, we should not consider the Tjikotok\ngoldmine as a property of Tjikotok only, neither is it owned by West\nJava alone, but the Tjikotok goldmine is for the benefit of the whole\nof Indonesia. The same applies to the Ratatex factory which is a\nprivate enterprise for the benefit of the whole of Indonesia. The\nGresik cement factory is another example which is catering to the\nneeds of the whole Indonesian nation. The same goes for the Indarung\ncement factory and the Madukismo sugar factory under the direction\nof Sultan Hamengku Buwono. A sense of unity must be strongly imprinted\nin our minds, not only in the military field, but also in the political\nas well as the economic field.\n\nVigilance as mentioned in the slogan on the wall here behind\nme is, as I said before, but one of the pre-requisites for the building\nof\n\nARSIP NASIONAL REPUBLIK INDONESIA\n"
