We are blessed with a country whose beauty has no equal in\nthe whole world. Not only is Indonesia the most beautiful in the world,\nbut it is also the richest. It is rich in resources above as well as\nunder the ground. I have seen most of the countries in the world,\nin Europe, Asia, the northern part of Africa, America and Canada;\nafter having travelled in those countries I can convincingly say that\nIndonesia is the most beautiful and the richest of them all.\n\nThis beauty of our country could be utilized as a source of income\nfor the people; I am referring to tourism.\n\nWhen, sometime ago, I attended the closing reception at the Na-\ntional Tourist conference in Sourabaya, I said in my speech that\nwe should increase excursions by school children; we could even make the\nexcursions compulsory in the schools, and intensify visits to different\nparts of our country.\n\nTourism by foreigners from abroad is International tourism.\n\nThis, I believe, is a good occasion to invite all of you, especially\nthe journalists, to popularize a new Indonesian word which I have found for\n\"tourism\". Earlier I said that compulsory excursions by schoolchildren\nare called \"darmawisata\" in Indonesia, \"Darma\" means \"duty\", \"wisata\"\nstands for \"excursions\". But for \"tourism\" which is not done by school\nchildren and which is not compulsory, the word \"darmawisata\" is not\nquite\n"
