Indeed, we have to be especially vigilant\nlately, because there have been clear indications of activities from\nwithin as well as outside the country to undermine and to divide, even\nto destroy our Republic. That is why the whole Indonesian nation must\nbe alert and prepared for eventualities.\n\nIt is with feelings of joy and gratification that I open the\nTjikotok goldmine today, because it constitutes a step in the right\ndirection towards economic defensibleness; indirectly it also brings\nus closer to military as well as political defensibleness.\n\nIf the Indonesian people remain united spiritually and also\nremain united in their endeavours, determination and their prayers, the\nIndonesian nation inevitably will become a strong nation. The Republic\nof Indonesia will become a strong Republic. There is no doubt about\nit, because I firmly believe that God will crown our efforts with\nsuccess and will grant us whatever we request or pray for.\n\nI declare the Tjikotok goldmine open. Thank you.\n"
