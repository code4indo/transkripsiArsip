I have searched for another word, and finally found\none, namely \"pariwisata\". \"Pari\" means \"all around\", \"pariwisata\" there-\nfore, stands for \"excursions all around\" or \"tourism all over the world\".\nI request the journalists to popularize the words \"darmawisata\" and\n\"pariwisata\". As I said before, one of my tasks today is to inspect\na place together with Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono, which we hope will be\na good object for \"darmawisata\" and \"pariwisata\".\nThe other duty I have to perform today is the official opening\nof the Tjikotok goldmine. Behind me here I have noticed a written slog-\ngam: \"Only unity and vigilance can save our country\". I fully agree\nwith it. But it is not enough. In order to save our country and make it\nstrong we have to meet three requirements; this I said already at the\nbeginning of our revolution.\nThese three requirements are: political, military and economic defensi-\nbleness. They constitute an absolute prerequisite in order to build up\nour country into a strong one. Fortunately we are heading in the right\ndirection and step by step we are on our way towards the fulfilment of\nthose three requisites.\nWe have demonstrated lately that our political defensibleness is\nbecoming stronger. What are the contents of this political defensi-\nbleness? Simply this: nothing less than a united Republik of Indonesia\nover a territory stretching from Sabang to Merauke! Our Republik was\nestablished on the 17th of August 1945 out of a conviction which has\ngrown within us for scores of years; the conviction that we are one\nnation, that we wanted to achieve independence, that we wanted to\nestablish a nation whose structure is a united republik. This convic-\ntion is becoming more and more deeply rooted in the hearts of the\nIndonesian people, and although during the past few months adventures\nhave tried to undermine this spirit, the Indonesian people have de-\nmonstrated their unshakable belief in a policy of unity and a united\nRepublik\nARSIP NASIONAL REPUBLIK INDONESIA\n---\n\nPerlu dicatat bahwa beberapa bagian kata agak kabur dalam gambar, tetapi saya telah berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk mentranskripsikan teks secara akurat.\n"
